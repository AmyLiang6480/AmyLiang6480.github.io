                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of our app is to help grandparents prepare meals and plan activities that their grandchildren would enjoy. This app was created to address the gap in the childcare services of grandparents who may not have formal training in childcare.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Before embarking on the app design, our team conducted extensive and multi-faceted research to gain insights into the needs and preferences of grandparents and their grandchildren, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Our research revealed that approximately 38% of grandparents actively take care of their grandkids, highlighting the significance of our target user group. </p>
                <p>To ensure seamless and enjoyable interactions between grandparents and grandchildren, we explored their expectations and identified the need for an app that recommends age-appropriate food and activities.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>My role as a visual and UX designer in the team, I created sketches and user flows in Figma and FigJam, ensuring that the app would offer an easy-to-use and intuitive experience. To provide a wide range of options for grandparents, I conducted thorough research on specific food and activity items prefered by children in different ages on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.</p>
                <p>Based on our research, we explored different design pathways presented by interaction storyboards.</p>

                <p>After careful consideration, we finalized the design and proceeded to create an interactive prototype using Protopie. This prototype allowed us to visualize how the app would function in real-life scenarios. We tested the prototype internally to ensure that it was user-friendly and intuitive.</p>

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>To gain valuable feedback, we conducted user testing studies involving seniors as grandparents. Throughout these studies, I played an active role in gathering feedback, making detailed notes, and observing user interactions. </p>
                <p>Analyzing the collected data involved a meticulous process. We employed thematic analysis techniques to identify recurring patterns, themes, and sentiments expressed by participants. By employing these methods, we were able to identify problems and sources of confusion.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The major issue became to one of our key feature: a family page where user could save their grandchildrenâ€™s information, so when they select specific grandchild, the app can filter content for them based on their age, dietary preferences and restrictions. </p>
                <p>But this feature confused most users in our user testing. </p>
                <p>It conflicts our ultimate goal of offering a light user experience and easier time planning for grandparents when their grandchildren come over.  </p>

                <h2>Evolution of Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>To address this challenge, I deviate from the original concept of a Family Page and conceived an an innovative solution called "My Family Cloud" and designed high-fidelity mockups and interactions by my own. With this feature, senior users could share a link with their family members, granting them access to a webpage specifically designed to manage and edit content and information. The intention behind this feature was to alleviate the burden on senior users by allowing their younger family members to take on the responsibility of managing their grandchildren's information.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We created a user-friendly and intuitive app for grandparents to prepare meals and plan activities for their grandkids. </p>
                <p>My design decisions were driven by a desire to create an intuitive and personalized experience for grandparents, taking into account their unique needs and preferences. </p>
                <p>Throughout the project, I honed my skills in design thinking, user research, and prototyping by actively participated in the iterative process, refining designs based on user feedback and continuously evolving the app's features and functionalities. </p>
