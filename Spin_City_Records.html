                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The project involved the research-driven development of a fictional company website, which sells vinyl records. Our website aimed to offer an engaging online platform that would attract vinyl enthusiasts, provide them with a seamless browsing and purchasing experience, and showcase the unique collection of vinyl records available for sale. </p>

                <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                <p>As a team leader, I effectively utilized GitKraken to distribute the work among three team members and later merge the changes. By creating branches for each feature, we were able to work simultaneously on different aspects of the project without hindering each other's progress. </p>
                <p>Additionally, we established regular check-ins to ensure alignment and meet our deadlines.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>In terms of the design process, I took the lead in consolidating our style guides into a comprehensive document. This guide played a pivotal role in ensuring consistency and cohesion across the design elements of our project. </p>
                <p>To develop the style guide, I took the lead in consolidating our existing design assets and guidelines into a single, coherent document. I carefully analyzed and synthesized the various components, such as typography, color schemes, imagery, and layout principles, to create a unified visual language for our project.</p>
                <p>I was also responsible for creating and designing icons, banners, and graphical assets on Figma, adding a cohesive aesthetic to the project.</p>

                <h2>Design Decision</h2>
                <p>Throughout the project, I encountered various design decisions that required careful consideration and a strong command of HTML and CSS. By leveraging my skills and knowledge, I made informed choices to optimize layouts and enhance the project's overall visual appeal and responsiveness.</p>
                <p>One significant decision I made was to transition from using positioning techniques to adopting the flexbox layout model. Recognizing the limitations and complexities associated with positioning, I determined that utilizing flexbox would provide a more flexible and efficient way to achieve the desired layout drawing upon my expertise in CSS.</p>

                <p>Our team focused on code validity, readability, and maintaining a well-structured folder hierarchy. I ensured that our code adhered to the project requirements and utilized meaningful names for files and folders. Following best practices, I made the code maintainable and easy to read. </p>
                <p>Moreover, I took the initiative to thoroughly test the code, promptly addressing any issues that arose.</p>

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>Our team focused on effective information architecture, relevant content, and responsive and usability. To gather feedback on usability, I conducted user testing among four peers and two teaching assistances who represented a diverse range of potential users.</p>
                <p>During the usability testing sessions, I observed and collected valuable feedback on various aspects of the project and documentated on FigJam, including navigation, interaction elements, content clarity and hierachy, and overall usability. I encouraged participants to use "think-aloud" method to express their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions, allowing me to gain insights into areas that required improvement.</p>

                <p>Since the team consisted of three members who worked on different devices(desktops), there were times when conflicts and errors in layout, color, and appearance arose. This challenge threatened to undermine the website's overall user experience and accessibility.</p>
